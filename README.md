# Statistics-based knowledge assessment web application

Test web application for knowledge assesstment.

## What is it?
This application is developed for use at educational organisations. The main idea is to determine whether a student passed the assesstment using statistical approach. The application determines the threshold that can be passed by chance for the assesstment a student is passing. If the student overcomes that threshold the assessment is passed and the result is positive.

## Dependencies
The Python interpreter itself, of course :)
The web part of the project is based on the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework.
To process the test files, the app requires BeautilfulSoup lib.

## Installation
Just install Flask using pip:
    pip install flask
Then install BeautilfulSoup:
    pip install beautilfulsoup4
