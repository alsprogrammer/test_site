# Statistics-based knowledge assessment web application

The work currently is in progress. We are moving to the S.O.L.I.D. approach, the structure of the storage is changed a bit. The system is not working at the moment, but I'm working on it.

This is a web application for knowledge assesstment.

## What is it?
This application is developed to be used at educational organisations (for my own use mostly, of course). The main idea is to determine whether a student passed the assesstment or not using statistical approach. The application determines the threshold that can be passed by chance for the assesstment a student is passing. If the student overcomes that threshold the assessment is passed and the result is positive.

## Dependencies
The Python interpreter itself, of course, I'm currently using Python 3.7 :)
The web part of the project is based on the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework.

## Installation
To be developed now as we are moving to a new architecture.
